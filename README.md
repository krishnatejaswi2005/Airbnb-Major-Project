## Application Workflow

This section provides an overview of how the Wanderlust web application functions, including user interactions, data flow, and backend processes.

### 1. User Visits the Application
- **Public Access**: Any user visiting the website (even without logging in) can:
  - View all property listings.
  - View listing details, including images, descriptions, reviews, and location on a map.

### 2. User Registration and Login
- **Sign Up**: Users can create an account by registering with a username, email, and password. The password is securely hashed and salted using the Passport.js authentication package.
- **Login**: Registered users can log in to access additional features, such as creating and managing their own listings and reviews.
- **Session Management**: Upon login, user data is stored in an express session, with signed cookies for secure session handling. Users are notified with flash messages upon successful login or logout.

### 3. Creating a Property Listing (Authenticated Users Only)
- **Form Submission**: Logged-in users can create a new property listing by filling out a form with details like the listing name, description, location, and uploading images.
- **Image Upload**: Images are uploaded and stored on Cloudinary, a cloud storage service.
- **Location Mapping**: The location entered by the user is geocoded using the Mapbox API, converting it to coordinates, which are then marked on an interactive map within the listing.
- **Database Storage**: Listing details are saved to Mongo Atlas via Mongoose, which facilitates easy data management.

### 4. Viewing and Interacting with Listings
- **Listing Page**: Each listing has a dedicated page displaying:
  - Property images, location on a map, reviews, and other details.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can view listings based on search terms or apply filters, though the search bar and filters are placeholders without functionality in this version.

### 5. Managing Listings (Authenticated Users Only)
- **Edit or Delete**: Users can only edit or delete their own listings.
  - **Edit Listing**: Users can update details like images, description, and location of their listings.
  - **Delete Listing**: Users can remove their listings permanently. All associated data, including reviews, is updated in the database.
- **Authorization**: Authorization checks are in place to prevent users from modifying or deleting listings that donâ€™t belong to them.

### 6. Reviews System (Authenticated Users Only)
- **Adding a Review**: Logged-in users can leave a review on any listing with a rating (1-5 stars) and a comment. Star ratings are implemented using the Starability package.
- **Review Management**: Users can delete only their own reviews, ensuring data integrity and secure access control.

### 7. Client and Server-Side Validation
- **Client-Side Validation**: Form inputs are validated on the client side to provide immediate feedback to the user.
- **Server-Side Validation**: Joi schema middlewares validate all incoming data on the server to prevent invalid entries from being stored in the database.

### 8. Error Handling and Flash Messages
- **Error Handling**: Runtime errors and exceptions are managed with WrapAsync and express-error, ensuring a smooth user experience and descriptive error feedback.
- **Flash Messages**: Flash messages notify users about actions (e.g., successful login, logout, listing creation, etc.) to enhance the interaction flow.

### 9. User Logout
- **Logout**: Users can log out at any time, clearing their session data and signing them out securely. Flash messages confirm a successful logout.

### 10. Database and Deployment
- **Database**: All user, listing, and review data is stored on MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based database solution.
- **Deployment**: The application is hosted on Render.com, making it accessible from any device. Responsive design ensures the application is accessible and functional on both mobile and desktop devices.
